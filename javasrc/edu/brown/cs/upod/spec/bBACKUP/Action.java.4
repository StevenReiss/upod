/**
 *	This interface defines an action that can be triggered by a set of user

 *	Actions typically releate to setting a particular state of a particular
 *	entity.  The Action interface needs to define what is meant by an entity,
 *	a state, a state change, etc.  It also has to define how we determine when
 *	two actions may be in conflict with one another.
 *
 *	There are a set of standard action implementations.  One is a combination
 *	which implies a set of actions that should be taken simultaneously.
