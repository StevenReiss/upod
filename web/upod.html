Welcome To UPOD-SMARTSIGN
</div>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
UPOD is a general framework for creating, organizing, exploring, and applying a
set of rules based on a set of sensors and conditions.  It is designed to handle
tasks such as whole house automation.
</p>
<p>
The initial demonstration of the capabilities of UPOD is an implementation of
our SmartSign.  This is a picture frame hung outside Dr. Reiss's office that
displays his current status.  The status is updated automatically based on a
number of sensors and a dynamic set of rules.  The sensors include:
<ul>
<li>Whether Dr. Reiss is in his office or not by checking whether his phone is
visible via bluetooth.
</li>
<li>Whether Dr. Reiss is on the phone or not using a off-the-hook circuit
connected to the phone line.
</li>
<li>
Whether Dr. Reiss has a visitor or not using a motion detector aimed at
his couch and visitor's chair.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition, the rules can query his Google calendar, can check whether he
has been in at all for the day, can tell if he has been out of the office for
less than 5 minutes, and specific or repeated time slots.
</p>
<p>
The goal of our initial research is to explore different user interfaces
that would let a non-technical program understand and program the sign.
To date we have developed three different interfaces:
<ul>
<li>The <a href='smartsigna.html'>first</a> shows the current rule set in
priority order, lets the user rearrange the priorities by direct manipluation,
and provides facilities for creating new rules and editing existing rules.
</li>
<li>The <a href='smartsignb.html'>second</a> lets the user set the various
conditions for a new rule and dynamically shows the set of conflicting
rules for those conditions so that the user can get a sense of what rules
would be overrriden if the new rule was created in its current state.
</li>
<li>The <a href='smartsignc.html'>third</a> takes a machine language approach.
Here the user specifies the raw state of the sensors (including time), and the
system displays what the sign would normally display under those conditions.
The user can then change the display and ask the system to learn a new rule
that would set the sign accordingly under these conditions.  The learning is
based on the current setting, all previous such settings, the history of the
sensor states over time, and any rules that were either default rules or were
created explicitly using the first or second interface.  The creation of rules
using this mechanism is still under development.
